       " Document(page_content='Introduction\\nNew hardware is increasingly parallel, so new programming languages must\\nsupport concurrency or they will die.\\n“The way the processor industry is going is to add more and more cores, but\\nnobody knows how to program those things. I mean, two, yeah; four, not really;\\neight, forget it. ” —Steve Jobs, Apple1\\nWell, Steve was wrong; we do know how to program multicores. We program\\nthem in Erlang, and many of our programs just go faster as we add more\\ncores.\\nErlang was designed from the bottom up to program concurrent, distributed,\\nfault-tolerant, scalable, soft, real-time systems. Soft real-time systems are\\nsystems such as telephone exchanges, banking systems, and so on, where\\nrapid response times are important but it ’s not a disaster if the odd timing\\ndeadline is missed. Erlang systems have been deployed on a massive scale\\nand control significant parts of the world ’s mobile communication networks.\\nIf your problem is concurrent, if you are building a multiuser system, or if\\nyou are building a system that evolves with time, then using Erlang might\\nsave you a lot of work, since Erlang was explicitly designed for building such\\nsystems.\\n“It’s the mutable state, stupid. ” —Brian Goetz, Java Concurrency in Practice\\nErlang belongs to the family of functional programming languages . Functional\\nprogramming forbids code with side effects. Side effects and concurrency\\ndon’t mix. In Erlang it ’s OK to mutate state within an individual process but\\nnot for one process to tinker with the state of another process. Erlang has no\\nmutexes, no synchronized methods, and none of the paraphernalia of shared\\nmemory programming.\\n1.http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/apple-in-parallel-turning-the-pc-world-upside-down/\\nreport erratum  •  discuss www.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Processes interact by one method, and one method only, by exchanging\\nmessages. Processes share no data with other processes. This is the reason\\nwhy we can easily distribute Erlang programs over multicores or networks.\\nWhen we write an Erlang program, we do not implement it as a single process\\nthat does everything; we implement it as large numbers of small processes\\nthat do simple things and communicate with each other.\\nWhat ’s This Book About?\\nIt’s about concurrency. It ’s about distribution. It ’s about fault tolerance. It ’s\\nabout functional programming. It ’s about programming a distributed concur -\\nrent system without locks and mutexes but using only pure message passing.\\nIt’s about automatically speeding up your programs on multicore CPUs. It ’s\\nabout writing distributed applications that allow people to interact with each\\nother. It ’s about design patterns for writing fault-tolerant and distributed\\nsystems. It ’s about modeling concurrency and mapping those models onto\\ncomputer programs, a process I call concurrency-oriented programming .\\nWho Is This Book For?\\nThe target audience for this book ranges from the experienced Erlang program -\\nmer who wants to learn more about Erlang internals and the philosophy\\nbehind Erlang to the absolute beginner. The text has been reviewed by pro -\\ngrammers at all levels, from expert to beginner. One of the major differences\\nbetween the second and first editions has been the addition of a large amount\\nof explanatory material especially targeted at the beginner. Advanced Erlang\\nprogrammers can skip over the introductory material.\\nA second goal has been to demystify functional, concurrent, and distributed\\nprogramming and present it in a way that is appropriate to an audience that\\nhas no prior knowledge of concurrency or functional programming. Writing\\nfunctional programs and parallel programs has long been regarded as a “black\\nart”; this book is part of an ongoing attempt to change this.\\nWhile this book assumes no specific knowledge of either functional or concur -\\nrent programming, it is addressed to somebody who already is familiar with\\none or two programming languages.\\nWhen you come to a new programming language, it ’s often difficult to think\\nof “problems that are suitable for solution in the new language. ” The exercises\\ngive you a clue.

Material intended for\\nadvanced users, or that might change rapidly, has been moved to online\\nrepositories.\\nThe programming exercises proved so popular in the first edition that exercises\\nnow appear at the end of each chapter. The exercises vary in complexity, so\\nthere ’s something for both beginner users and advanced users.\\nIn several completely new chapters, you ’ll learn about the Erlang type system\\nand the Dialyzer, maps (which are new to Erlang, as of R17), websockets,\\nprogramming idioms, and integrating third-party code. A new appendix\\ndescribes how to build a minimal stand-alone Erlang system.\\nThe final chapter, “Sherlock ’s Last Case, ” is a new chapter that gives you an\\nexercise in processing and extracting meaning from a large volume of text.\\nThis is an open-ended chapter, and I hope that the exercises at the end of\\nthis chapter will stimulate future work.\\nRoad Map\\nYou can ’t run until you can walk.

In particular, we need to distinguish between concurrent and parallel\\nprograms.\\nIf we have only a single-core computer, then we can never run a parallel\\nprogram on it. This is because we have one CPU, and it can do only one thing\\nat a time. We can, however, run concurrent programs on a single-core com -\\nputer. The computer time-shares between the different tasks, maintaining\\nthe illusion that the different tasks run in parallel.\\nIn the following sections, we ’ll start with some simple concurrency modeling,\\nmove on to see the benefits of solving problems using concurrency, and\\nfinally look at some precise definitions that highlight the differences between\\nconcurrency and parallelism.\\n1.1 Modeling Concurrency\\nWe’ll start with a simple example and build a concurrent model of an everyday\\nscene.

However,\\nonce it gets a value, it keeps it forever.\\nAt this point, you ’re probably wondering why we use the name variables .

As we said earlier, variables\\ncan be given a value only once. The first time we say X=SomeExpression , Erlang\\nsays to itself, “What can I do to make this statement true? ” Because X doesn ’t\\nyet have a value, it can bind X to the value of SomeExpression , the statement\\nbecomes valid, and everyone is happy.\\nIf at a later stage we say X=AnotherExpression , the match will succeed only if\\nSomeExpression  and AnotherExpression  are identical.

Using the quoted\\nform, we can create atoms that start with uppercase letters (which otherwise\\nwould be interpreted as variables) or that contain nonalphanumeric characters,\\nfor example, 'Monday' , 'Tuesday' , '+', '*', 'anatomwithspaces' . You can even quote\\natoms that don ’t need to be quoted, so 'a' means exactly the same as a. In\\nsome languages, single and double quotes can be used interchangeably.

We can create a tuple by enclosing the values we want\\nto represent in curly brackets and separating them with commas. So, for\\nexample, if we want to represent someone ’s name and height, we might use\\n{joe,1.82}.

If you imagine removing\\nthe head from the list, what ’s left is called the tail of the list.\\nFor example, if we have a list [1,2,3,4,5] , then the head of the list is the integer\\n1, and the tail is the list [2,3,4,5] .

The vertical bar ( |)\\nseparates the head of a list from its tail. [] is the empty list.\\nNote for LISP programmers: [H|T] is a CONS cell with CAR H and CDR T.

When a string is represented as a list of integers, each element in the list\\nrepresents a Unicode codepoint.\\nWe can create such a list by using a string literal. A string literal  is just a\\nsequence of characters enclosed in double quotation marks ( \"), so, for example,\\nwe can write this:\\n1>Name=\"Hello\".\\n\"Hello\"\\n\"Hello\"  is just shorthand for the list of integer character codes that represent\\nthe individual characters in that string.\\nNote: In some programming languages, strings can be quoted with either\\nsingle or double quotes. In Erlang, we must use double quotes.\\nWhen the shell prints the value of a list, it prints it as a string literal if all the\\nintegers in the list represent printable characters; otherwise, it prints it in\\nlist notation (for character set issues, see Section 8.8, Character Set , on page\\n122).\\nreport erratum  •  discussStrings  • 39\\nwww.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 52}),\n",

Once I ’m happy with it, I write a few more functions,\\ncompile them, test them, and so on.\\nOften I haven ’t really decided what sort of data structures I ’ll need in my program,\\nand as I run small examples, I can see whether the data structures I have chosen\\nare appropriate.\\nI tend to “grow ” programs rather than think them out completely before writing them.\\nThis way I don ’t tend to make large mistakes before I discover that things have gone\\nwrong. Above all, it ’s fun, I get immediate feedback, and I see whether my ideas work\\nas soon as I have typed in the program.\\nOnce I ’ve figured out how to do something in the shell, I usually then go and write a\\nmakefile and some code that reproduces what I ’ve learned in the shell.\\nNote also the use of the -import  and -export  declarations in the module.\\n•The declaration -import(lists, [map/2,sum/1]).  means the function map/2 i s\\nimported  from the module lists, and so on. This means we can write map(Fun,\\n...) instead of lists:map(Fun, ...). cost/1 was not declared in an import declaration,\\nso we had to use the “fully qualified ” name shop:cost .\\n•The declaration -export([total/1])  means the function total/1  can be called from\\noutside the module shop2. Only functions that are exported from a module\\ncan be called from outside the module.\\nBy this time you might think that our total function cannot be further improved,\\nbut you ’d be wrong. Further improvement is possible. To do so, we ’ll use a\\nlist comprehension.\\n4.5 List Comprehensions\\nList comprehensions  are expressions that create lists without having to use\\nfuns, maps, or filters. This makes our programs even shorter and easier to\\nunderstand.\\nWe’ll start with an example. Suppose we have a list L.\\n1>L=[1,2,3,4,5].\\n[1,2,3,4,5]\\nAnd say we want to double every element in the list.

Using guards, we can perform simple tests and comparisons on\\nthe variables in a pattern. Suppose we want to write a function max(X,Y) that\\ncomputes the max of X and Y. We can write this using a guard as follows:\\nmax(X,Y)whenX>Y->X;\\nmax(X,Y)->Y.\\nThe first clause matches when X is greater than Y and the result is X.\\nIf the first clause doesn ’t match, then the second clause is tried. The second\\nclause always returns the second argument Y. Y must be greater than or equal\\nto X; otherwise, the first clause would have matched.\\nYou can use guards in the heads of function definitions where they are\\nintroduced by the when keyword, or you can use them at any place in the\\nlanguage where an expression is allowed.

Or course, if they want an exception to\\nbe generated, then they omit the additional true guard.\\n4.9 Building Lists in Natural Order\\nThe most efficient way to build a list is to add the elements to the head of an\\nexisting list, so we often see code with this kind of pattern:\\nsome_function([H|T], ...,Result, ...)->\\nH1=...H...,\\nsome_function(T, ...,[H1|Result], ...);\\nsome_function([], ...,Result, ...)->\\n{...,Result, ...}.\\nThis code walks down a list extracting the head of the list H and computes\\nsome value based on this function (we can call this H1); it then adds H1 to the\\noutput list Result. When the input list is exhausted, the final clause matches,\\nand the output variable Result is returned from the function.\\nThe elements in Result are in the opposite order as the elements in the original\\nlist, which may or may not be a problem, but if they are in the wrong order,\\nthey can easily be reversed in the final step.\\nThe basic idea is fairly simple.\\n1.Always add elements to a list head.\\n2.Taking the elements from the head of an InputList  and adding them head\\nfirst to an OutputList  results in the OutputList  having the reverse order of\\nthe InputList .\\n3.If the order matters, then call lists:reverse/1 , which is highly optimized.\\n4.Avoid going against these recommendations.\\nNote: Whenever you want to reverse a list, you should call lists:reverse  and\\nnothing else. If you look in the source code for the module lists, you ’ll find a\\ndefinition of reverse . However, this definition is simply used for illustration.\\nThe compiler, when it finds a call to lists:reverse , calls a more efficient internal\\nversion of the function.Chapter 4.

Records are really just tuples in\\ndisguise. Using records we can associate a name with each element in a tuple.\\nMaps are associative collections of key-value pairs. The key can be any Erlang\\nterm. In Perl and Ruby they are called hashes; in C++ and Java they are called\\nmaps, in Lua they are called tables, and in Python they are called dictionaries.\\nUsing records and maps makes programming easier; instead of remembering\\nwhere a data item is stored in a complex data structure, we just use the name\\nof the item and the system figures out where the data is stored. Records use\\na fixed and predefined set of names; maps can add new names dynamically.\\n5.1 When to Use Maps or Records\\nRecords are just tuples in disguise, so they have the same storage and perfor -\\nmance characteristics as tuples. Maps use more storage than tuples and have\\nslower lookup properties. On the other hand, maps are far more flexible than\\ntuples.\\nRecords should be used in the following cases:\\n•When you can represent your data using a fixed number of predetermined\\natoms\\n•When the number of elements in the record and the names of the elements\\nwill not change with time\\n•When storage is an issue, typically when you have a large array of tuples\\nand each tuple has the same structure\\nreport erratum  •  discuss www.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

This means that dealing with errors\\nat runtime is crucially important. We take error handling very seriously in\\nErlang. When errors occur, we need to detect them, correct them, and\\ncontinue.\\nTypical Erlang applications are composed of dozens to millions of concurrent\\nprocesses. Having large numbers of processes changes how we think about\\nerror handling. In a sequential language with only one process, it is crucially\\nimportant that this process does not crash. If we have large numbers of pro -\\ncesses, it is not so important if a process crashes, provided some other process\\ncan detect the crash and take over whatever the crashed process was supposed\\nto be doing.\\nTo build really fault-tolerant systems, we need more than one computer; after\\nall, the entire computer might crash. So, the idea of detecting failure and\\nresuming the computation elsewhere has to be extended to networked\\ncomputers.\\nTo fully understand error handling, we first need to look at error handling in\\nsequential programs and then, having understood this, see how to handle\\nerrors in collections of parallel processes. This chapter looks at the former\\nproblem. Handling errors in parallel processes is dealt with in Chapter 13,\\nErrors in Concurrent Programs , on page 199 , and building sets of processes\\nthat collaborate to correct errors is the subject of Section 23.5, The Supervision\\nTree, on page 396 .\\nreport erratum  •  discuss www.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 98}),\n",

Most C compilers, for example, define a char (the least addressable unit of\\nstorage) to be 8 bits wide. Manipulating bits within a char is complicated, since to\\naccess individual bits, they have to masked out and shifted into registers. Writing\\nsuch code is tricky and error-prone.\\nIn Erlang the least addressable unit of storage is a bit, and individual sequences of\\nbits within a bitstring can be accessed directly without any shifting and masking\\noperations.\\nIn the previous example, B1 is a binary, but B2 is a bitstring since it is 17 bits\\nlong. We construct B2 with the syntax <<1:17>> , and it is printed as <<0,0,1:1>> ,\\nthat is, as a binary literal whose third segment is a bitstring of length 1. The\\nbit size of B2 is 17, and the byte size is 3 (this is actually the size of the binary\\nthat contains the bitstring).\\nWorking with bitstrings is tricky.

We ’ll talk about a workflow we should use\\nwith the dialyzer and about the kind of errors that the dialyzer cannot find.\\nWe’ll wrap up with a little theory of how the dialyzer works, which will help\\nus understand the errors that the dialyzer finds.\\n9.1 Specifying Data and Function Types\\nWe are going on a walking tour and are lucky enough to have a module that\\nwe can use to plan our walks.

Traditionally, client-server\\narchitectures have involved a network that separates a client from a server.\\nMost often there are multiple instances of the client and a single server. The\\nword server  often conjures up a mental image of some rather heavyweight\\nsoftware running on a specialized machine.\\nIn our case, a much lighter-weight mechanism is involved. The client and\\nserver in a client-server architecture are separate processes, and normal\\nErlang message passing is used for communication between the client and\\nthe server. Both client and server can run on the same machine or on two\\ndifferent machines.\\nThe words client  and server  refer to the roles that these two processes have;\\nthe client always initiates a computation by sending a request  to the server.\\nThe server computes a reply and sends a response  to the client.\\nLet’s write our first client-server application. We ’ll start by making some small\\nchanges to the program we wrote in the previous section.Chapter 12.

To send a response, the client has\\nto include an address to which the server can reply.

This can be done by changing\\nthis:\\nPid!{rectangle,6,10}\\nto the following:\\nPid!{self(),{rectangle, 6,10}}\\nself() is the PID of the client process.\\nTo respond to the request, we have to change the code that receives the\\nrequests from this:\\nloop()->\\nreceive\\n{rectangle, Width,Ht}->\\nio:format( \"Areaofrectangle is~p~n\",[Width *Ht]),\\nloop()\\n...\\nto the following:\\nloop()->\\nreceive\\n{From,{rectangle, Width,Ht}}->\\nFrom!Width*Ht,\\nloop();\\n...\\nNote how we now send the result of our calculation back to the process\\nidentified by the F r o m parameter.

The problem with this is that loop() never returns; instead, it just loops\\nforever. So, each time we pass line 5, another return address gets pushed\\nonto the control stack, and eventually the system runs out of space.\\nAvoiding this is easy; if you write a function F that never returns (such as\\nloop()), make sure you never call anything after calling F, and don ’t use F in a\\nlist or tuple constructor.\\n12.8 Spawning with MFAs or Funs\\nSpawning a function with an explicit module, function name, and argument\\nlist (called an MFA) is the proper way to ensure that our running processes\\nwill be correctly updated with new versions of the module code if it is compiled\\nwhile it is being used.

Instead of handling an error in the process\\nwhere the error occurs, we let the process die and correct the error in some\\nother process.\\nWhen we design a fault-tolerant system, we assume that errors will occur,\\nthat processes will crash, and that machines will fail.

Unfortunately,\\nthis leads to large quantities of error checking code, which is intertwined with\\nthe non-error-checking code.\\nIn Erlang we do exactly the opposite. We build our applications in two parts:\\na part that solves the problem and a part that corrects errors if they have\\noccurred.\\nThe part that solves the problem is written with as little defensive code as\\npossible; we assume that all arguments to functions are correct and the\\nprograms will execute without errors.\\nThe part that corrects errors is often generic , so the same error-correcting\\ncode can be used for many different applications.

Having spawned a remote process, we ’ll see that\\nall the other primitives, send, receive , link, and so on, work transparently over\\na network in the same way as they worked on a single node.\\nIn this chapter, we ’ll introduce the libraries and Erlang primitives that we ’ll\\nuse to write distributed Erlang programs. Distributed programs  are programs\\nthat are designed to run on networks of computers and that can coordinate\\ntheir activities only by message passing.\\nHere are some reasons why we might want to write distributed applications:\\nPerformance\\nWe can make our programs go faster by arranging that different parts of\\nthe program are run in parallel on different machines.\\nReliability\\nWe can make fault-tolerant systems by structuring the system to run on\\nseveral machines. If one machine fails, we can continue on another machine.\\nScalability\\nAs we scale up an application, sooner or later we will exhaust the capabil -\\nities of even the most powerful machine. At this stage, we have to add\\nmore machines to add capacity. Adding a new machine should be a simple\\noperation that doesn ’t require large changes to the application architecture.\\nIntrinsically distributed application\\nMany applications are inherently distributed. If we write a multiuser game\\nor chat system, different users will be scattered all over the globe. If we\\nhave a large number of users in a particular geographic location, we want\\nto place the computation resources near the users.\\nreport erratum  •  discuss www.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 218}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Fun\\nMost of the fun programs that I want to write are distributed. Many of\\nthese involve interaction with people and machines all over the world.\\n14.1 Two Models for Distribution\\nIn this book we ’ll talk about two main models of distribution.\\nDistributed Erlang In distributed Erlang, programs are written to run on\\nErlang nodes . A node is a self-contained Erlang system containing a\\ncomplete virtual machine with its own address space and own set of\\nprocesses.\\nWe can spawn a process on any node, and all the message passing and\\nerror handling primitives we talked about in previous chapters work as\\nin the single node case.\\nDistributed Erlang applications run in a trusted  environment —since any\\nnode can perform any operation on any other Erlang node, a high degree\\nof trust is involved. Typically distributed Erlang applications will be run\\non clusters on the same LAN and behind a firewall, though they can run\\nin an open network.\\nSocket-based distribution  Using TCP/IP sockets, we can write distributed\\napplications that can run in an untrusted  environment. The programming\\nmodel is less powerful than that used in distributed Erlang but more\\nsecure. In Section 14.6, Socket-Based Distribution , on page 224 , we’ll see\\nhow to make applications using a simple socket-based distribution\\nmechanism.\\nIf you think back to the previous chapters, you ’ll recall that the basic unit\\nthat we construct programs from is the process. Writing a distributed Erlang\\nprogram is easy; all we have to do is spawn our processes on the correct\\nmachines, and then everything works as before.\\nWe are all used to writing sequential programs. Writing distributed programs\\nis usually a lot more difficult. In this chapter, we ’ll look at a number of tech -\\nniques for writing simple distributed programs. Even though the programs\\nare simple, they are very useful.\\nWe’ll start with a number of small examples. To do this, we ’ll need to learn\\nonly two things; then we can make our first distributed program. We ’ll learn\\nhow to start an Erlang node and how to perform a remote procedure call on\\na remote Erlang node.Chapter 14.

       " Document(page_content='14.2 Writing a Distributed Program\\nWhen I develop a distributed application, I always work on the program in a\\nspecific order, which is as follows:\\n1.I write and test my program in a regular nondistributed Erlang session.\\nThis is what we ’ve been doing up to now, so it presents no new challenges.\\n2.I test my program on two different Erlang nodes running on the same\\ncomputer .\\n3.I test my program on two different Erlang nodes running on two physically\\nseparated computers  either in the same local area network or anywhere\\non the Internet.\\nThe final step can be problematic. If we run on machines within the same\\nadministrative domain, this is rarely a problem. But when the nodes involved\\nbelong to machines in different domains, we can run into problems with\\nconnectivity, and we have to ensure that our system firewalls and security\\nsettings are correctly configured.\\nTo illustrate these steps, we ’ll make a simple name server. Specifically, we\\nwill do the following:\\n•Stage 1: Write and test the name server in a regular undistributed Erlang\\nsystem.\\n•Stage 2: Test the name server on two nodes on the same machine.\\n•Stage 3: Test the name server on two different nodes on two different\\nmachines on the same local area network.\\n•Stage 4: Test the name server on two different machines belonging to two\\ndifferent domains in two different countries.\\n14.3 Building the Name Server\\nA name server  is a program that, given a name, returns a value associated\\nwith that name. We can also change the value associated with a particular\\nname.\\nOur first name server is extremely simple. It is not fault tolerant, so all the\\ndata it stores will be lost if it crashes.

When we have two nodes on the\\nsame machine, we use “short ” names (as indicated by the -sname  flag), but\\nif they are on different networks, we use -name.\\nWe can also use -sname  on two different machines when they are on the\\nsame subnet. Using -sname  is also the only method that will work if no\\nDNS service is available.\\n2.Ensure that both nodes have the same cookie . This is why both nodes\\nwere started with the command-line argument -setcookieabc. We’ll talk more\\nabout cookies later in this chapter in Section 14.5, The Cookie Protection\\nSystem , on page 222 . Note:  When we ran two nodes on the same  machine,\\nboth nodes could access the same cookie file, $HOME/.erlang.cookie , which is\\nwhy we didn ’t have to add the cookie to the Erlang command line.\\n3.Make sure the fully qualified hostnames of the nodes concerned are\\nresolvable by DNS.

Distributed Erlang applications\\nrunning across the Internet should first set up secure connections between\\nhosts and then use the cookie protection system.\\n•Method 1 : Store the same cookie in the file $HOME/.erlang.cookie .

We can interface\\nforeign language programs to Erlang in a number of ways.\\n•By running the programs outside  the Erlang virtual machine in an external\\noperating system process. This is the safe way of doing things. If the for -\\neign language code is incorrect, it will not crash the Erlang system. Erlang\\ncontrols the external process through a device called a port and commu -\\nnicates with the external process through a byte-oriented communication\\nchannel. Erlang is responsible for starting and stopping the external\\nprogram and can monitor and restart it if it crashes. The external process\\nis called a port process  since it is controlled through an Erlang port.\\n•By running an OS command from within Erlang and capturing the result.\\n•By running the foreign language code inside  the Erlang virtual machine.\\nThis involves linking the code with the code for the Erlang virtual machine.\\nThis is the unsafe  way of doing things. Errors in the foreign language code\\nmight crash the Erlang system. Although it is unsafe, it is useful since it\\nis more efficient than using an external process.\\nLinking code into the Erlang kernel can be used only for languages like\\nC that produce native object code and can ’t be used with languages like\\nJava that have their own virtual machines.\\nIn this chapter we ’ll look at interfacing Erlang using ports and OS commands.\\nIn addition, there are a number of advanced interfacing techniques using\\nlinked-in drivers, natively implemented functions (NIFs), and C-nodes.

Messages from the external program will appear\\nas Erlang messages that come from the ports.\\nAs far as the programmer is concerned, the port behaves just like an Erlang\\nprocess. You can send messages to it, you can register it (just like a process),\\nand so on. If the external program crashes, then an exit signal will be sent\\nto the connected process, and if the connected process dies, then the external\\nprogram will be killed.\\nNote the difference between using a port to communicate with an external\\nprocess and a socket. If you use a port, the port will behave like an Erlang\\nprocess, so you can link to it, send messages to it from a remote distributed\\nErlang node, and so on. If you use a socket, it will not behave like a process.\\nThe process that creates a port is called the connected process  for that port.\\nThe connected process has a special significance: all messages to the port\\nmust be tagged with the PID of the connected process, and all messages from\\nthe external program are sent to the connected processes.\\nWe can see the relationship between a connected process (C), a port (P), and\\nan external operating system process in the following figure:\\n ERTS \\n C  P  External Program \\n ERTS = Erlang runtime system \\n C = An Erlang process that is connected to the port  P = A port \\nTo create a port, we call open_port , which is specified as follows:\\n-specopen_port(PortName, [Opt])->Port\\nPortName  is one of the following:Chapter 15.

This can in fact\\nbe rather difficult, because Erlang happily manages integers of an arbitrary\\nsize, whereas languages such as C have fixed ideas about the precision\\nof integers and so on.\\n•We couldn ’t just run the Erlang functions without first having started the\\ndriver that was responsible for the interface (that is, some program had\\nto evaluate example1:start() before  we were able to run the program). We\\nwould like to be able to do this automatically when the system is started.\\nThis is perfectly possible but needs some knowledge of how the system\\nstarts and stops. We ’ll deal with this later in Section 23.7, The Application ,\\non page 403 .\\n15.3 Calling a Shell Script from Erlang\\nSuppose we want to call a shell script from Erlang. To do this, we can use\\nthe library function os:cmd(Str) . This runs the command in the string Str and\\ncaptures the result. Here ’s an example using the ifconfig  command:\\n1>os:cmd(\"ifconfig\").\\n\"lo0:flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu16384\\\\n\\\\t...\\nThe result will need parsing to extract the information we are interested in.\\n15.4 Advanced Interfacing Techniques\\nIn addition to the techniques discussed earlier, there are a few additional\\ntechniques available for interfacing Erlang to external programs.\\nThe techniques described next are being continually improved and tend to\\nchange with time more rapidly than Erlang itself. For this reason, they are\\nnot described here in detail. The descriptions have been moved into online\\narchives so that they can be updated more quickly.Chapter 15.

We ’ll start by writing\\nfive little programs that open a file and input the data in a number of ways.\\nThe contents of a file are just a sequence of bytes. Whether they mean anything\\ndepends upon the interpretation of these bytes.\\nTo demonstrate this, we ’ll use the same input file for all our examples. It\\nactually contains a sequence of Erlang terms. Depending upon how we open\\nand read the file, we can interpret the contents as a sequence of Erlang terms,\\nas a sequence of text lines, or as raw chunks of binary data with no particular\\ninterpretation.\\nHere ’s the raw data in the file:\\ndata1.dat\\n{person, \"joe\",\"armstrong\",\\n[{occupation, programmer},\\n{favoriteLanguage, erlang}]}.\\n{cat,{name,\"zorro\"},\\n{owner, \"joe\"}}.\\nNow we ’ll read parts of this file in a number of ways.\\nReading All the Terms in the File\\ndata1.dat  contains a sequence of Erlang terms; we can read all of these by\\ncalling file:consult  as follows:\\n1>file:consult(\"data1.dat\").\\n{ok,[{person,\"joe\",\\n\"armstrong\",\\n[{occupation,programmer},{favoriteLanguage,erlang}]},\\n{cat,{name,\"zorro\"},{owner,\"joe\"}}]}\\nfile:consult(File)  assumes that File contains a sequence of Erlang terms.

First here ’s the\\nprogram header:\\nscavenge_urls.erl\\n-module(scavenge_urls).\\n-export([urls2htmlFile/2, bin2urls/1]).\\n-import(lists, [reverse/1, reverse/2, map/2]).\\nThe program has two entry points. urls2htmlFile(Urls, File) takes a list of URLs and\\ncreates an HTML file containing clickable links for each URL, and bin2urls(Bin)\\nsearches through a binary and returns a list of all the URLs contained in the\\nbinary. urls2htmlFile  is as follows:\\nreport erratum  •  discussWays to Write a File  • 253\\nwww.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 257}),\n",

You might like to try modifying this code to fetch and store an\\nentire website or automatically go and read your email. The possibilities are\\nboundless.\\nA Simple TCP Server\\nIn the previous section, we wrote a simple client. Now let ’s write a server.\\nThis server opens port 2345 and then waits for a single message. This message\\nis a binary that contains an Erlang term. The term is an Erlang string that\\ncontains an expression. The server evaluates the expression and sends the\\nresult to the client by writing the result to the socket.\\nTo write this program (and indeed any program that runs over TCP/IP), we\\nhave to answer a few simple questions.\\n•How is the data organized? How do we know how much data makes up\\na single request or response?\\n•How is the data within a request or the response encoded and decoded?\\n(Encoding the data is sometimes called marshaling , and decoding the data\\nis sometimes called demarshaling .)\\nTCP socket data is just an undifferentiated stream of bytes. During transmission,\\nthis data can be broken into arbitrary-sized fragments, so we need some conven -\\ntion so that we know how much data represents a single request or response.\\nIn the Erlang case we use the simple convention that every logical request or\\nresponse will be preceded by an N (1, 2, or 4) byte length count. This is the\\nmeaning of the {packet,N} argument in the gen_tcp:connect  and gen_tcp:listen\\nfunctions. The word packet  here refers to the length of an application request\\nor response message, not to the physical packet seen on the wire. Note that\\nthe arguments to packet  used by the client and the server must agree. If the\\nserver was opened with {packet,2}  and the client with {packet,4} , then nothing\\nwould work.\\nHaving opened a socket with the {packet,N}  option, we don ’t need to worry\\nabout data fragmentation.

Our server uses a file containing a list of song titles we\\ncreated in Reading MP3 Metadata , on page 249 . Audio files are chosen at\\nrandom from this list.\\n2.Make a parallel server so we can serve several streams in parallel. We do\\nthis using the techniques described in A Parallel Server , on page 271 .\\n3.For each audio file, we want to send only the audio data and not the\\nembedded ID3 tags to the client. Audio encoders are supposed to skip\\nover bad data, so in principle we could send the ID3 tags along with the\\ndata.

This way, we can\\neasily build distributed applications and integrate them with a web browser.\\nErlang thinks that the web browser is just another Erlang process, which\\nsimplifies our programming model, putting everything into the same concep -\\ntual framework.\\nWe’re going to pretend that a web browser is an Erlang process. If we want\\nthe browser to do something, we ’ll send it a message; if something happens\\nwithin the browser that we need to attend to, the browser will send us a\\nmessage. All of this is possible thanks to websockets . Websockets are part\\nof the HTML5 standard and are bidirectional asynchronous sockets that can\\nbe used to pass messages between a browser and an external program. In\\nour case, the external program is the Erlang runtime system.\\nTo interface the Erlang runtime system to websockets, we run a simple Erlang\\nweb server, called cowboy , to manage the socket and the websocket protocol.\\nDetails of how to install cowboy are covered in Chapter 25, Third-Party Pro -\\ngrams , on page 425 . To simplify things, we assume that all messages between\\nErlang and the browser are JSON messages.\\nOn the Erlang side of the application these messages appear as Erlang maps\\n(see Section 5.3, Maps: Associative Key-Value Stores , on page 79 ), and in the\\nbrowser these messages appear as JavaScript objects.\\nIn the rest of this chapter, we ’ll look at six example programs, including the\\ncode that runs in the browser and the code that runs in the server.

As far as we are concerned, the interesting parts of\\nthe code are the part that runs in the browser and the part that runs in the\\nserver.\\nAll the examples use a simple technique for controlling the browser from\\nErlang.

It is set up with the\\nfollowing code:\\nwebsocket =newWebSocket(wsUri);\\n...\\nwebsocket.onmessage =onMessage;\\nThe callback is defined like this:\\nfunction onMessage(evt) {\\nvarjson=JSON.parse(evt.data);\\ndo_cmds(json);\\n}\\nfunction do_cmds(objs){\\n1.http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/\\nreport erratum  •  discussThe Browser Server Protocol  • 301\\nwww.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 304}),\n",

For each object x in the list, the system checks whether there is a\\nfunction called x.cmd, and if there is, it calls x.cmd(x) . So, {cmd:\\'fill_div\\', id:\\'id123\\',\\ntxt:\\'abc\\'}  causes the following:\\nfill_div({cmd: \\'fill_div\\' ,id:\\'id123\\',txt:\\'abc\\'})\\nto be called. This method of encoding and evaluating commands is easily\\nextensible so we can add more commands to the interface as necessary.\\nMessages from the Browser to Erlang\\nIn the browser when we click a button, we evaluate commands like this:\\nsend_json({\\'clicked\\':txt}));\\nsend_json(x)  encodes the argument x as a JSON term and writes it to the web-\\nsocket. This message is received in websocket.erl  where it is converted to a frame\\nand sent to the controlling process that manages the websocket.\\nWe have seen how to extend the notion of message passing to outside Erlang\\nand use message passing to directly control a browser. From the point of view\\nof an Erlang programmer, the world now consists of a well-ordered space\\nwhere everything responds to Erlang messages. We don ’t have one way of\\ndoing things inside Erlang and another way of doing things outside Erlang.\\nThis adds a sense of order and unity to our programs, making a complex\\nworld appear simple. A web browser is, of course, a massively complicated\\nobject. But by making it respond in a predictable manner to a small number\\nof messages, we can easily contain this complexity and harness it to build\\npowerful applications.Chapter 18.

In particular, ETS tables are\\nnot garbage collected; this means there are no garbage collection penalties\\ninvolved in using extremely large ETS tables, though slight penalties are\\nincurred when we create or access ETS objects.\\n19.1 Types of Table\\nETS and DETS tables store tuples. One of the elements in the tuple (by default,\\nthe first) is called the key of the table. We insert tuples into the table and\\nextract tuples from the table based on the key. What happens when we insert\\na tuple into a table depends upon the type of the table and the value of the\\nkey. Some tables, called sets, require that all the keys in the table are unique.\\nOthers, called bags, allow several tuples to have the same key.\\nChoosing the correct type of table has important consequences for the perfor -\\nmance of your applications.\\nEach of the basic set and bag table types has two variants, making for a total\\nof four types of table: sets, ordered sets, bags, and duplicate bags. In a set,\\nall the keys in the different tuples in the table must be unique. In an ordered\\nset, the tuples are sorted. In a bag there can be more than one tuple with the\\nsame key, but no two tuples in the bag can be identical. In a duplicate bag\\nseveral tuples can have the same key, and the same tuple can occur many\\ntimes in the same table.\\nThere are four basic operations on ETS and DETS tables.\\nCreate a new table or open an existing table.\\nThis we do with ets:new  or dets:open_file .\\nInsert a tuple or several tuples into a table.\\nHere we call insert(TableId, X), where X is a tuple or a list of tuples. insert has\\nthe same arguments and works the same way in ETS and DETS.\\nLook up a tuple in a table.\\nHere we call lookup(TableID, Key). The result is a list of tuples matching K e y.\\nlookup  is defined for both ETS and DETS.\\nThe return value of lookup is always a list of tuples. This is so we can use\\nthe same lookup function on bags and sets. If the table type is a bag, then\\nseveral tuples can have the same key, but if the table type is a set, then\\nthere will be only one element in the list if the lookup succeeds.

This means there is a slight\\nspace penalty for using sets and a time penalty for using ordered sets.\\nInserting into sets takes place in constant time, but inserting into an ordered\\nset takes place in a time proportional to the log of the number of entries in\\nthe table.\\nWhen you choose between a set and an ordered set, you should think about\\nwhat you want to do with the table after it has been constructed —if you want\\na sorted table, then use an ordered set.\\nBags are more expensive to use than duplicate bags, since on each insertion\\nall elements with the same key have to be compared for equality. If there are\\nlarge numbers of tuples with the same key, this can be rather inefficient.\\nETS tables are stored in a separate storage area that is not associated with\\nnormal process memory. An ETS table is said to be owned by the process\\nthat created it —when that process dies or when ets:delete  is called, then the\\ntable is deleted. ETS tables are not garbage collected, which means that large\\namounts of data can be stored in the table without incurring garbage collection\\npenalties.\\nWhen a tuple is inserted into an ETS table, all the data structures representing\\nthe tuple are copied from the process stack and heap into the ETS table.\\nWhen a lookup operation is performed on a table, the resultant tuples are\\ncopied from the ETS table to the stack and heap of the process.\\nThis is true for all data structures except large binaries. Large binaries are\\nstored in their own off-heap storage area. This area can be shared by several\\nprocesses and ETS tables, and the individual binaries are managed with a\\nreference-counting garbage collector that keeps track of how many different\\nprocesses and ETS tables use the binary. When the use count for the number\\nof processes and tables that use a particular binary goes down to zero, then\\nthe storage area for the binary can be reclaimed.\\nAll of this might sound rather complicated, but the upshot is that sending\\nmessages between processes that contain large binaries is very cheap, and\\ninserting tuples into ETS tables that contain binaries is also very cheap.

This is a\\nnice “show-off ” program that demonstrates the power of the ETS tables.\\nOur goal is to write a heuristic program that tries to predict whether a given\\nstring is an English word.\\nTo predict whether a random sequence of letters is an English word, we ’ll\\nanalyze which trigrams  occur in the word. A trigram is a sequence of three\\nletters. Now, not all sequences of three letters can occur in a valid English\\nword. For example, there are no English words where the three-letter combi -\\nnations akj and rwb occur. So, to test whether a string might be an English\\nword, all we have to do is test all sequences of three consecutive letters in\\nthe string against the set of trigrams generated from a large set of English\\nwords.\\nThe first thing our program does is to compute all trigrams in the English\\nlanguage from a very large set of words. To do this, we use ETS sets. The\\ndecision to use an ETS set is based on a set of measurements of the relative\\nperformances of ETS sets and ordered sets and of using “pure ” Erlang sets\\nas provided by the sets module.\\nThis is what we ’re going to do in the next few sections:\\n1.Make an iterator  that runs through all the trigrams in the English lan -\\nguage. This will greatly simplify writing code to insert the trigrams into\\ndifferent table types.\\n2.Create ETS tables of type set and ordered_set  to represent all these trigrams.\\nAlso, build a set containing all these trigrams.\\n3.Measure the time to build  these different tables.\\n4.Measure the time to access  these different tables.Chapter 19.

These operations fall into the following categories:\\n•Fetching and deleting objects based on a pattern\\n•Converting between ETS and DETS tables and between ETS tables and\\ndisk files\\n•Finding resource usage for a table\\n•Traversing all elements in a table\\n•Repairing a broken DETS table\\n•Visualizing a table\\nMore information about ETS3 and DETS4 is available online.\\nETS and DETS tables were designed for efficient low-level in-memory and\\ndisk storage of Erlang terms, but this is not the end of the story. For more\\nsophisticated data storage, we need a database.\\nIn the next chapter, we ’ll introduce Mnesia, which is a real-time database\\nwritten in Erlang and which is part of the standard Erlang distribution.\\nMnesia uses ETS and DETS tables internally, and a lot of the routines\\nexported from the ets and dets modules are intended for internal use from\\nMnesia. Mnesia can do all kinds of operations that are not possible using\\nsingle ETS and DETS tables. For example, we can index on more than the\\nprimary key, so the kind of double insertion trick that we used in the file-\\nname2index  example is not necessary. Mnesia will actually create several ETS\\nor DETS tables to do this, but this is hidden from the user.\\nExercises\\n1.Mod:module_info(exports)  returns a list of all the exported functions in the\\nmodule Mod. Use this function to find all the exported functions from the\\nErlang system libraries. Make a key-value lookup table where the key is\\na {Function,Arity}  pair and the value is a module name.

Tracing a process (or processes) provides a powerful way of\\nunderstanding how your system behaves and can be used to test complex\\nsystems without modifying the code. This is particularly useful in embedded\\nsystems or where you cannot modify the code being tested.\\nAt a low level, we can set up a trace by calling a number of Erlang BIFs. Using\\nthese BIFs for setting up complex traces is difficult, so several libraries are\\ndesigned to make this task easier.\\nWe’ll start by looking at the low-level Erlang BIFs for tracing and see how to\\nset up a simple tracer; then we ’ll review the libraries that can provide a\\nhigher-level interface to the trace BIFs.\\nFor low-level tracing, two BIFs are particularly important. erlang:trace/3  says,\\nbasically, “I want to monitor this process, so please send me a message if\\nsomething interesting happens. ” erlang:trace_pattern  defines what counts as being\\n“interesting. ”\\nerlang:trace(PidSpec, How,FlagList)\\nThis starts tracing. PidSpec  tells the system what to trace. How is a boolean\\nthat can turn the trace on or off. FlagList  governs what is to be traced (for\\nexample, we can trace all function calls, all messages being sent, when\\ngarbage collections occur, and so on).\\nOnce we have called erlang:trace/3 , the process that called this BIF will be\\nsent trace messages when trace events occur. The trace events themselves\\nare determined by calling erlang:trace_pattern/3 .\\nerlang:trace_pattern(MFA, MatchSpec,FlagList)\\nThis is used to set up a trace pattern . If the pattern is matched, then the\\nactions requested are performed. Here MFA is a {Module,Function,Args} tuple\\nthat says to which code the trace pattern applies. MatchSpec  is a pattern\\nthat is tested every time the function specified by MFA is entered, and\\nFlagList  tells what to do if the tracing conditions are satisfied.\\nWriting match specifications for MatchSpec  is complicated and doesn ’t really\\nadd much to our understanding of tracing.

The standard Erlang distribution contains the OTP libraries.\\nOTP contains a number of powerful tools —such as a complete web server,\\nan FTP server, a CORBA ORB,1 and so on —all written in Erlang. OTP also\\ncontains state-of-the-art tools for building telecom applications with imple -\\nmentations of H248, SNMP, and an ASN.1-to-Erlang cross-compiler (these\\nare commonly used protocols in the telecommunications industry). I ’m not\\ngoing to talk about these here; you can find a lot more about these subjects\\nat the Erlang website.2\\nIf you want to program your own applications using OTP, then the central\\nconcept that you will find useful is the OTP behavior . A behavior encapsulates\\ncommon behavioral patterns —think of it as an application framework that is\\nparameterized by a callback  module.\\nThe power of OTP comes from the fact that properties such as fault tolerance,\\nscalability, dynamic-code upgrade, and so on, can be provided by the behavior\\nitself. In other words, the writer of the callback does not have to worry about\\nthings such as fault tolerance because this is provided by the behavior. For\\nthe Java-minded, you can think of a behavior as a J2EE container.\\nPut simply, the behavior solves the nonfunctional parts of the problem, while\\nthe callback solves the functional parts.

The main benefit of this is that the code neatly factors into two\\nparts. The generic component deals with many aspects of the concurrency\\nand error handling, and the handler has only sequential code.\\nFollowing this, we introduced the first major behavior in the OTP system, the\\ngen_server , and showed how it could be built from a fairly simple and easy-to-\\nunderstand server in a number of small transformation steps.\\nThe gen_server  can be used for many purposes, but it is not a universal panacea.\\nSometimes the client-server interaction pattern of the gen_server  feels awkward\\nand does not fit naturally with your problem.

If we change our mind later and decide\\nthat we want to do something else, we have no easy way of changing the behavior of\\nthe system.\\nThe Erlang way of handling events is completely different. It allows us to decouple\\nthe generation of the event from the processing of the event. We can change the pro -\\ncessing at any time we want by just sending a new handler function to the event\\nhandler. Nothing is statically linked, and the event handlers can be changed whenever\\nyou want.\\nUsing this mechanism, we can build systems that evolve with time  and that never\\nneed to be stopped to upgrade the code.\\nNote: This is not “late binding ”—it’s “very late binding, and you can change your mind\\nlater. ”\\nan error.

Discussing this in detail is not\\nparticularly interesting. We ’ll use only error_msg  in our programs anyway.

We can see all errors in the\\nErlang shell (this is the default if we don ’t do anything special). We can write\\nall errors that are reported in the shell into a single formatted text file.\\nFinally, we can create a rotating log . You can think of the rotating log as a\\nlarge circular buffer containing messages produced by the error logger. As\\nnew messages come, they are appended to the end of the log, and when the\\nlog is full, the earliest entries in the log are deleted.\\nThe rotating log is extremely useful. You decide how many files the log should\\noccupy and how big each individual log file should be, and the system takes\\ncare of deleting old log files and creating new files in a large circular buffer.\\nYou can size the log to keep a record of the last few days of operations, which\\nis usually sufficient for most purposes.\\nThe Standard Error Loggers\\nWhen we start Erlang, we can give the system a boot argument .\\n$erl-bootstart_clean\\nThis creates an environment suited for program development. Only a\\nsimple form of error logging is provided. (The command erl with no boot\\nargument is equivalent to erl-bootstart_clean .)Chapter 23.

But when we start combining\\nsimple things, the result can exhibit very complex behavior. Even if you don ’t\\nsolve these problems immediately, thinking about them will help you structure\\nthe solution to problems like this into manageable chunks. To build large\\nfault-tolerant systems, we need to think about what the servers do, how to\\nrestart failed servers, how to load balance, how and where to replicate data,\\nand so on. The exercises are arranged so as to guide you through this process.\\n1.Make a gen_server  called prime_tester_server  that tests if a given number is\\nprime. You can use the is_prime/2  function in lib_primes.erl  to do this (or\\nimplement a better prime number tester yourself). Add this to the super -\\nvisor tree in sellaprime_supervisor.erl .\\n2.Make a pool of ten prime tester servers. Make a queue server that queues\\nrequests until one of the prime tester servers become free. When a prime\\ntester server becomes free, send it a request to test a number for primality.\\n3.Change the code in the prime server testers so that each prime server\\ntester maintains its own queue of requests. Remove the queue server.\\nWrite a load balancer that keeps track of the work being done and requests\\nto be done by the prime server testers. Requests to test new primes should\\nnow be sent to the load balancer. Arrange that the load balancer sends\\nrequests to the least loaded server.\\n4.Implement a supervisor hierarchy so that if any prime number tester\\nserver crashes, it should be restarted. If the load balancer crashes, crash\\nall the prime number tester servers and restart everything.\\n5.Keep the data necessary to restart everything replicated on two machines.\\n6.Implement a restart strategy to restart everything if an entire machine\\ncrashes.Chapter 23.

Having such a view of the world\\nimposes conceptual integrity  on our designs, making them easier to under -\\nstand.\\nImagine we want to write a web server in Erlang.

The simplest possible web server looks like this:\\nweb_server(Client) ->\\nreceive\\n{Client, {get,Page}}->\\ncasefile:read(Page) of\\n{ok,Bin}->\\nClient!{self(), {data,Bin}};\\n{error, _}->\\nClient!{self(), error}\\nend,\\nweb_server(Client)\\nend.\\nBut this code is simple only because all it does is receive and send Erlang\\nterms. But clients don ’t send us Erlang terms; they send us HTTP requests,\\nwhich are far more complicated.

       " Document(page_content='To simplify things, we interpose a process called a middle man  between the\\nTCP driver that receives messages from the HTTP client and our Erlang\\nserver. The middle man parses the HTTP requests and turns them into Erlang\\nmessages. This is shown in the following figure. You can see why the transla -\\ntion process is called a middle man; it sits between the TCP driver and the\\nweb server.\\nAs far as the server is concerned, the objects in the external world only “speak ”\\nErlang. Instead of having one process that does two things (handling HTTP\\nrequests and serving the requests), we now have two processes, each with a\\nclearly defined role. The middle man knows only how to convert between HTTP\\nand Erlang messages. The server knows nothing about the details of the HTTP\\nprotocol but just deals with pure Erlang messages. Breaking this into two\\nprocesses not only makes the design clearer but has an additional benefit; it\\ncan increase concurrency. Both processes can execute in parallel.\\nThe flow of messages concerned in satisfying an HTTP request is shown in\\nFigure 5, Web Server Protocol , on page 415 .\\nExactly how the middle man works is not relevant to this discussion. All it\\nhas to do is parse incoming HTTP requests, convert them into Erlang terms,\\nand convert outgoing Erlang terms into HTTP responses.\\nIn our example we chose to abstract out a lot of the detail in the HTML request.\\nHTML request headers contain a lot of additional information that we did not\\nshow here. As part of the design of the middle man, we have to decide exactly\\nhow much detail of the underlying protocol we want to expose to the Erlang\\napplication.\\nSuppose we want to extend this and respond to FTP requests for files or for\\nfiles to be sent over an IRC channel. We can structure the processes in our\\nsystem as shown in Figure 6, Unified Messages , on page 415 .\\nHTTP, FTP, and IRC all use entirely different protocols  for transferring files\\nbetween machines.

We can use this mechanism for information\\nhiding and creating adapter modules that hide the details of an interface from\\nprograms that use the interface. This is useful if we want to make a common\\ninterface to several dissimilar modules or mimic some of the features of object-\\noriented programming.\\nWhen we call X:Func(....) , X does not have to be an atom.

We ’ll illustrate this\\nfirst with a simple stateful counter and then move on to an example that\\ncreates an adapter module for two existing modules.\\nA Counter with State\\nTo illustrate the idea of a tuple module, we ’ll start with a simple example of\\na counter that has a single state parameter, N, which represents the value of\\na counter. The code is as follows:\\ncounter.erl\\n-module(counter).\\n-export([bump/2, read/1]).\\nbump(N, {counter,K}) ->{counter, N+K}.\\nread({counter, N})->N.\\nWe can test this code as follows.

These libraries might have a similar functional\\ninterface but different performance characteristics. As an example, consider\\nkey-value stores: one store might keep keys and values in memory, and\\nanother might keep keys in memory and values on disk. Yet another might\\nkeep keys with small values in memory but store large values on disk. Even\\nfor something as simple as a key-value store there are many variations on\\nhow the store is actually implemented.\\nSuppose we want to write some code that makes use of a key-value store. At\\nthe time when we write our application, we have to make a design decision\\nand choose a particular key-value store from those available. At a much later\\ndate, some of our design decisions might prove to be mistaken, and we might\\nwant to change the back-end store. Unfortunately, if the APIs used to access\\nthe old and new stores are different, then we might have to make a large\\nnumber of changes to our program.\\nThis is where the adapter  pattern comes in. Adapters are tuple modules that\\nprovide a uniform interface toward an application.\\nWe’ll illustrate this by building an adapter pattern that provides identical\\ninterfaces to a key-value store, which is implemented using the modules lists\\nand dict.

First is init/3, which gets called\\nwhen a fresh connection is made to the web server.\\ncowboy/simple_web_server.erl\\ninit({tcp, http},Req,_Opts)->\\n{ok,Req,undefined}.\\ninit is called with three arguments. The first says what type of connection has\\nbeen made to the server. In this case, it ’s an HTTP connection. The second\\nargument is what cowboy calls a request object . The request object contains\\ninformation about the request and will eventually contain information that\\nis sent back to the browser. Cowboy provides a large set of functions for\\nextracting information from the request object and for storing information in\\nthe request object that will be subsequently sent to the browser. The third\\nargument to init (Opt) is whatever was given as the third argument in the dis -\\npatch tuple in the call to cowboy_router:compile/1 .\\ninit/3 conventionally returns the tuple {ok,Req,State} , which causes the web\\nserver to accept the connection.

Do we have to bother parallelizing our\\nprogram so that it can run on a multicore? The answer is yes. Today, quad cores with\\nhyperthreads are commonplace. Smartphones can have quadcores. Even my lowly\\nMacBook Air has a dual core with hyperthreading, and my desktop has eight cores\\nwith hyperthreading.\\nMaking a program go twice as fast on a dual-core machine is not that exciting (but\\nit is a little bit exciting).

The clock speeds on dual-core\\nprocessors are slower than on a single-core CPU, so the performance gains can be\\nmarginal.\\nNow although two times doesn ’t get me excited, ten times does, and a hundred times\\nis really, really exciting. Modern processors are so fast that a single core can run 4\\nhyperthreads, so a 32-core CPU might give us an equivalent of 128 threads to play\\nwith. This means that a hundred times faster is within striking distance.\\nA factor of one hundred does make me excited.\\nAll we have to do is write the code.\\nUse Lots of Processes\\nThis is important —we have to keep the CPUs busy. All the CPUs should be\\nbusy all the time. The easiest way to achieve this is to have lots of processes.\\nWhen I say lots of processes, I mean lots in relation to the number of CPUs.\\nIf we have lots of processes, then we won ’t need to worry about keeping the\\nCPUs busy. This appears to be a purely statistical effect.

It ’s a bad idea\\nto write programs where one process does a lot of work and the others do\\nvery little.\\nIn many applications we get lots of processes “for free. ” If the application is\\n“intrinsically parallel, ” then we don ’t have to worry about parallelizing our\\ncode. For example, if we ’re writing a messaging system that manages some\\ntens of thousands of simultaneous connections, then we get the concurrency\\nfrom the tens of thousands of connections; the code that handles an individ -\\nual connection will not have to worry about concurrency.\\nAvoid Side Effects\\nSide effects prevent concurrency. Right in the beginning of the book we talked\\nabout “variables that do not vary. ” This is the key to understanding why\\nErlang programs can run faster on a multicore CPU than programs written\\nin languages that can destructively modify memory.\\nIn a language with shared memory and threads, a disaster might happen if\\ntwo threads write to common memory at the same time. Systems with shared\\nmemory concurrency prevent this by locking the shared memory while the\\nmemory is being written to. These locks are hidden from the programmer and\\nappear as mutex or synchronized methods in their programming languages.\\nThe main problem with shared memory is that one thread can corrupt the\\nmemory used by another thread. So, even if my program is correct, another\\nthread can mess up my data structures and cause my program to crash.\\nErlang does not have shared memory, so this problem does not exist. Actually,\\nthis is not quite true. There are only two ways to share memory, and the\\nproblem can be easily avoided. These two ways of sharing memory have to\\ndo with shared ETS or DETS tables.\\nDon’t Use Shared ETS or DETS Tables\\nETS tables can be shared by several processes. In Section 19.3, Creating an\\nETS Table , on page 309 , we talked about the different ways of creating an ETS\\ntable.

What is not possible\\nis performing a sequence of ETS operations as one atomic unit. Although we\\ncannot corrupt the data in an ETS table, the tables can become logically\\ninconsistent if several processes try to simultaneously update a shared table\\nwithout coordinating their activities.\\nNote 2 : The ETS table type protected  is far safer. Only one process (the owner)\\ncan write to this table, but several processes can read the table. This property\\nis guaranteed  by the system.

This should be avoided.\\nNote: ETS and DETS were created in order to implement Mnesia and were\\nnot originally intended for stand-alone use.

Partitioning the data is the key to parallelizing\\nthe program. process_all_years() , which we used to build the data store, is defined\\nlike this:\\nprocess_all_years() ->\\n[process_year(I) ||I<-mail_years()].\\nprocess_year(Year)  processes all the data for a specific year, and mail_years/0  returns\\na list of years.\\nTo parallelize the program, all you have to do is change the definition of\\nprocess_all_years  and call pmap, which we talked about in Section 26.3, Paralleliz -\\ning Sequential Code , on page 445 . With this small change, our function looks\\nlike this:\\nprocess_all_years() ->\\nlib_misc:pmap( fun(I)->process_year(I) end,mail_years()).\\nThere is an additional and less obvious benefit. To test that our program works,\\nwe have to work with only one of the years.  If I had a seventeen-or-more-core\\nmonster machine, I could run all the year computations in parallel. There\\nare seventeen years of data, so I ’d need at least seventeen CPUs and a disk\\ncontroller that allowed seventeen parallel input operations.

This is called the cosine similarity4 of the\\ndocuments.

       " Document(page_content='The Significance of a Word: The TF*IDF Weight\\nA commonly used measure of significance for words is the so-called TF*IDF\\nweight. TF stands for term frequency , and IDF stands for inverse document\\nfrequency . Many search engines use the TF*IDF weights of words in a docu -\\nment to rank the significance of words and to find similar documents in a\\ncollection. In this section, we ’ll look at how TF*IDF weights are computed.\\nIn the literature describing search methods, you ’ll find the word corpus  used\\na lot. A corpus is a large set of reference documents. In our case, the corpus\\nis the set of 73,445 mails to the Erlang mailing list.\\nThe first thing we need to do to compute TF*IDF weights is to break the doc -\\numents we are interested in into a sequence of words. We ’ll assume that\\nwords are sequences of alphabetic characters separated by nonalphabetic\\ncharacters. Now suppose we find the word socket  in a particular document;\\nwhether or not this word is significant depends upon the context of the word.\\nWe’ll need to analyze a large number of documents before we can assess the\\nsignificance of an individual word.\\nSuppose the word socket  occurs in 1 percent of all the documents in the\\ncorpus. We can compute this by analyzing all the documents in the corpus\\nand counting how many documents contain the word socket .\\nIf we look at an individual document, it might also contain the word socket . The\\nnumber of times a document contains a word divided by the total number of\\nwords in the document is called the term frequency  of the word. So, if a document\\ncontains the word socket  five times and has one hundred words, then the term\\nfrequency of the word socket is 5 percent. If the frequency of the word socket  in\\nthe corpus is 1 percent, then the fact that our document uses the word 5 percent\\nof the time is highly significant, so we might like to choose socket  as a keyword\\nthat we could associate with the document. If the term frequency in our document\\nwas 1 percent, then it would have the same probability of occurrence as in the\\nparent corpus and thus have little significance.\\nThe term frequency  (TF) of a word in a document is simply the number of\\ntimes the word occurs in the document divided by the number of words in\\nthe document.\\nThe inverse document frequency  (IDF) of a word W is defined as log(Tot/N+1) ,\\nwhere T o t is the total number of documents in the corpus and N is the number\\nof documents that contain the word W.\\nFor example, suppose we have a corpus of 1,000 documents. Assume the\\nword orange  occurs in twenty-five documents.

If the word orange  occurs ten times in a document\\nof a hundred words, then the TF of orange  is 10/100 = (0.1), and the TM*IDF\\nweight of the word is 0.158.\\nTo find a set of keywords for a particular document, we compute the TF*IDF\\nweights of each word in the document and then take words having the highest\\nTF*IDF weights. We omit any words with very low TF*IDF weights.\\nWith these preliminaries taken care of, we can now compute which words in\\na document are good keywords. This is a two-pass process. The first pass\\ncomputes the IDF of each word in the corpus. The second pass computes the\\nkeywords in each document in the corpus.\\nCosine Similarity: The Similarity of Two Weighted Vectors\\nGiven two keyword vectors, we can compute the cosine similarity with a\\nsimple example. Assume we have two keyword vectors: K1 with keywords a,\\nb, and c, and K2 with keywords a, b, and d. The keywords and their associated\\nTF*IDF weights are as follows:\\n1>K1=[{a,0.5},{b,0.1},{c,0.2}].\\n[{a,0.5},{b,0.1},{c,0.2}]\\n2>K2=[{a,0.3},{b,0.2},{d,0.6}].\\n[{a,0.3},{b,0.2},{d,0.6}]\\nThe cross product of K1 and K2 is the sum of the product of weights of entities\\nwith identical keywords.\\n3>Cross=0.5*0.3 +0.1*0.2.\\n0.16999999999999998.\\nTo compute the cosine similarity, we divide the cross product by the norms\\nof each of the vectors.

The real world actually has independent\\nthings communicating through messages. I ’m an ex-physicist —we perceive\\nthe world by receiving messages. Packets of light and sound carry information.\\nAll that we know about the world is what we ’ve learned by receiving messages.\\nWe don ’t have shared memory. I have my memory, you have yours, and I\\ndon’t know what you think about anything. If I want to know what you think\\nabout something, then I have to ask you a question and wait for you to reply.\\nThe model of programming that Erlang uses is very similar to how the world\\nworks. This makes programming easy. Many programmers have discovered\\nthis, as have many companies.\\nSo, what now? Spread the word. Join the Erlang mailing list. Go to one of the\\nmany Erlang conferences that are organized around the world. Solve some\\ninteresting programs and try to make the world a better place.Chapter 27.

If you\\njust want to use lib_chan  and don ’t care about how it works, read the first\\nsection and skip the rest.\\nA2.1 An Example\\nWe’ll start with a simple example that shows how to use lib_chan . We’re going\\nto create a simple server that can compute factorials and Fibonacci numbers.\\nWe’ll protect it with a password.\\nThe server will operate on port 2233.\\nWe’ll take four steps to create this server.\\n1.Write a configuration file.\\n2.Write the code for the server.\\n3.Start the server.\\n4.Access the server over the network.\\nreport erratum  •  discuss www.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 474}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='APPENDIX 3\\nA Simple Execution Environment\\nIn this appendix we ’ll build a simple execution environment (SEE) for running\\nErlang programs. The code is in an appendix rather than the main body of\\nthe book since it is rather different in character. All the code in the book is\\nintended to be run in the standard Erlang/OTP distribution, whereas this\\ncode deliberately makes minimal use of Erlang library code and tries to use\\nonly the Erlang primitives.\\nWhen confronted with Erlang for the first time, it ’s often unclear what belongs\\nto the language and what belongs to the operating environment. OTP provides\\na rich environment, akin to an operating system for running long-lived dis -\\ntributed Erlang applications. But exactly what functionality is provided by\\nErlang (the language) and OTP (the environment) is unclear.\\nSEE provides an environment that is “nearer to the metal, ” giving a much\\nclearer distinction between what is provided by Erlang and what is provided\\nby OTP. All that is provided by SEE is contained in a single module. OTP\\nstarts by loading 60-odd modules, and it ’s not immediately apparent how\\nthings work, but none of this is particularly complicated if you know where\\nto look. The place to start is in the boot file. Start by looking at the boot file\\nand then by reading the code in init.erl, and all will be revealed.\\nThe SEE environment can be used for scripting, since it starts very quickly,\\nor for embedding, since it is very small. To achieve this, you ’ll learn how\\nErlang starts and how the code autoloading system works.\\nWhen you start a “standard ” Erlang system (with the shell command erl),\\nsixty-seven modules get loaded and twenty-five processes are started, and\\nonly then your program gets to run. This takes about a second. If the program\\nwe want to execute doesn ’t need all the goodies provided by the standard\\nsystem, we can cut this time down to a few tens of milliseconds.\\nreport erratum  •  discuss www.it-ebooks.info', metadata={'source': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zvuQfomh-OKq_kkUc_BiLZPhuvLoT2l5/view', 'title': 'Programming Erlang, 2nd Edition Software for a Concurrent World .pdf', 'page': 489}),\n",

SEE provides autoloading, generic server pro -\\ncesses, and error handling all in one module.\\nBefore we start on SEE, we ’ll gather some statistics on the OTP system that\\nwe’ll use for reference later.\\n$erl\\n1>length([I||{I,X} <-code:all_loaded(), X=/=preloaded]).\\n67\\n2>length(processes()).\\n25\\n3>length(registered()).\\n16\\ncode:all_loaded()  returns a list of all the modules that are currently loaded into\\nthe system. processes()  is a BIF that returns a list of all processes known to the\\nsystem, and registered()  returns a list of all registered processes.\\nSo, just starting the system loads sixty-seven modules and starts twenty-five\\nprocesses, of which sixteen are registered processes. Let ’s see if we can reduce\\nthis number.\\nA3.1 How Erlang Starts\\nWhen Erlang starts, it reads a boot file and executes the commands that it\\nfinds in the boot file. Eight Erlang modules are preloaded. These are Erlang\\nmodules that have been compiled into C and linked into the Erlang virtual\\nmachine. These eight modules are responsible for booting the system. They\\ninclude init.erl, which reads and evaluates commands in the boot file, and\\nerl_prim_loader , which knows how to load code into the system.\\nThe boot file contains a binary that was created by calling term_to_binary(Script) ,\\nwhere Script is a tuple containing a boot script.\\nWe’re going to make a new boot file called see.boot  and a script called see, which\\nlaunches a program using the new boot file. The boot file will load a small\\nnumber of modules, including see.erl , which contains our custom execution\\nenvironment. The boot file and script are created by evaluating make_scripts/0 .\\nsee/see.erl\\nmake_scripts() -> Line 1\\n{ok,Cwd}=file:get_cwd(), -\\nScript= -Appendix 3.

       " Document(page_content='A3.5 How Code Gets Loaded in Erlang\\nThe default mechanism for loading code into Erlang is to use a form of\\n“on-demand ” code loading. When code is first called and it is discovered that\\nthe code is missing, then the code is loaded.\\nThis is what happens. Assume the function my_mod:myfunc(Arg1, Arg2,...ArgN) is\\ncalled but the code for this module has not yet been loaded. The system\\nautomatically converts this call into the following call:\\nerror_module:undefined_function(mymod, myfunc,[Arg1,Arg2,...,ArgN])\\nundefined_function  is something like this:\\nundefined_function(Mod, Func,ArgList) ->\\ncasecode:load_module (Mod)of\\n{ok,Bin}->\\nerlang:load_module (Mod,Bin),\\napply(Mod,Func,ArgList);\\n{error, _}->\\n...\\nend\\nThe undefined function handler delegates the task of finding the code for the\\nmodule to the code handler. If the code handler can find the code, it loads\\nthe module and then calls apply(Mod,Func,ArgList) , and the system continues as\\nif the trap had not occurred.\\nThe code in SEE to do this follows this pattern:\\nsee/error_handler.erl\\n-module(error_handler).\\n-export([undefined_function/3,undefined_global_name/2]).\\nundefined_function(see, F,A)->\\nerlang:display({error_handler,undefined_function,\\nsee,F,A}),\\nexit(oops);\\nundefined_function(M, F,A)->\\nerlang:display({new_error_handler,undefined_function,M,F,A}),\\ncasesee:load_module (M)of\\n{ok,M}->\\ncaseerlang:function_exported (M,F,length(A))of\\ntrue->\\nerlang:display({error_handler,calling,M,F,A}),\\napply(M,F,A);\\nfalse->\\nsee:stop_system({undef,{M,F,A}})\\nend;\\n{ok,_Other} ->\\nsee:stop_system({undef,{M,F,A}});Appendix 3.

It does a lot more than the simple code handler here; it has to\\nkeep track of module versions and a few other things that make life\\ncomplicated.\\nOnce the error handler has been loaded by the boot script, autoloading will\\nthen work, using the code handling mechanisms in SEE and not the OTP\\nsystem.\\nExercises\\n1.SEE provides autoloading. But we could write an even simpler  one without\\nautoloading. Remove the code for autoloading.\\n2.You don ’t even need SEE for totally stand-alone applications. Write a\\nminimal program that writes “Hello world ” on standard output and\\nterminates.\\n3.Write a minimal cat program that copies standard input to standard output\\n(this is similar to see_test3.erl ) but that starts without using SEE.
